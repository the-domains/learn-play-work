# Schrödinger's Brexit

Oh dear, the [Europhobes who have driven us out of the EU ][0]won't like this at all. It's about the [Copenhagen interpretation][1] of one of [Einstein's more complex papers][2] (co-authored with Podolsky and Rosen). Gevalt! -- as he might have said -- Einstein was, of course, an immigrant. Brexit Britain will be having none of that.

Nonetheless, the famous thought experiment devised by the Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger\*, in which the cat in the box is both alive and dead at the same time, provides a useful analogy for the state of Britain today. Particularly in the terms presented by the 'Leave' campaign's majordomo in a [well-known UK newspaper][3].

Apparently, or so the frantically back-pedalling Brexitmeister would have us believe, we can be both _in_ and _out_ of Europe at the same time. Genius! Applying quantum uncertainty principles to EU membership! No wonder he's called the 'blond bombshell'. Hydrogen or neutron, I wonder?\*\*

Schrödinger is credited with a neologism which I wish to adopt as encapsulating our condition in the unfolding post-referendum nightmare -- _Verschränkung_. It means 'entanglement'.

[Someone call the Doctor!][4]

\*ouch, another EU reference -- sorry, Brexiters!

\*\*to quote another apposite song, _[The Push and the Shove][5]_ by the Golden Palominos, sure I'm angry.
